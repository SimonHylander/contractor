The following rules should be considered ALWAYS

# The package manager

This project uses `pnpm` for all package management and code-running.

# Code writing rules


When writing code, always look for `ai-docs.md` files in the directory tree you are working in.

There will most likely be a file somewhere in that tree that will help you write the code more correctly.
